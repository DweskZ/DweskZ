### 🚀 About Me

- 👨‍💼 I worked for 3 years in logistics and administration in the shrimp industry — it shaped how I approach challenges: with clarity, responsibility, and a problem-solving mindset.
- 💻 Today, I'm focused on growing as a developer. I love learning about **web technologies**, **distributed systems**, and **game development**.
- 🌱 I'm looking to join a team where I can **grow, contribute, and build tools that make a difference**.
